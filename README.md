# Detecting-the-Spam-messages-using-Keras-in-Python
SMS is the abbreviation for Short Messaging Service which uses standard protocols for mobile devices to exchange information via short text messages. 
Today SMS’s are an easy, inexpensive and widely accepted way to communicate rather than phone calls.
Spam can be described as random unsolicited messages sent at large without any authorization from the receiver. 
People still deal with spammer’s misusing SMS’s to advertise false claims and can gain access to private information of users. 
Emails, social media sites, review, and even Twitter has seen spammers trying to intrude everywhere with the advent of Internet. 
Spam appears in many forms like comments, emails, search results and personal messages where spammers tend to gain revenues.
Various Machine Learning algorithms like Neural Networks have tried to detect spam messages and normal messages or ham from SMS’s. 
These techniques can learn high level features automatically using raw data unlike traditional ways where features are selected after analysis for classification. 
In this research paper, we propose a new method utilizing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) using Keras models and Tensorflow backend to detect Spam and Ham from `SpamSMSCollection’ dataset available at UCI machine learning repository. Crucial preprocessing of dataset included tokenization, TF-IDF Vectorization and removal of stopwords. Overall accuracy of 98% is achieved and shows improvement from other machine learning algorithms for spam detection.

Mobile phone usage has increased in multiple folds in the last decade leading to a new area or platform for junk promotions from disreputable marketers and spammers.
People innocently give out their mobile phone numbers while giving feedbacks or utilizing day to day services and are then swarmed with spam promotional and marketing messages. Short Message Service (SMS) is considered among the widely used communication service. 
It is a text based platform that allows mobile phone users to send and receive short length text messages and also at a low cost or namely SMS. 
The amount of unsolicited commercial advertisements (spams) over SMS will be bigger since the cost of SMS will decrease.
The ubiquity of hand-held devices is expanding as they comply with a range of services. 
SMS have a very low cost of service and hence gain popularity among other services. 
SMS spam is not familiar compared to mail spam. 
SMS messages are also cost effective and have prompted the utilization of messages over telecom network. 
This ascent pulled in assailants, which have brought about SMS Spam problem.
Spam messages can have various kinds of words like marketing schemes, adverts, free business offers and services, slangs, etc.
